This software includes some part of stb(https://github.com/nothings/stb),

- converters/stb_image.h: public domain JPEG/PNG reader.
- converters/stb_image_write.h: public domain PNG/BMP/TGA writer.

These great works is written by Sean Barrett(@nothings) and some contributers.

Hayaki Saito(@saitoha) applied a small fix(patches/applied/stb_image.h.diff) for stb_image.h.
That patch is also in public domain.
